# Old Scripts Archive

This directory contains archived versions of scripts that have been refactored or replaced in the main `scripts/` directory. These files are kept in case needed for reference.

'enhanced_clean.py' 'get_full_seq.py' 'merge_data.py' were all generated as practice scripts for testing workglow. They are hardcoded and are kept as reference.
