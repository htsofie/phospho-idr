This is a github repository of folders on both mac and linux so that I can work on scripts from both. 
P53-practice is a folder of practice scripts to convert files to json for AF3 upload, and analysis of AF3 data from predictions and graph generation of pLDDT. It does not have much significance outside of practice. 
Phospho-mouse data is from the paper where they analyzed cell specific phosphorylation of 9 different mouse tissues.
